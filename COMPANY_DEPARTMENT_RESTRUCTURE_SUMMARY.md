# Company-Department Structure Restructure Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Added `is_parent_company` field** to `companies` table (boolean, default false)
- **Removed `company_id` field** from `departments` table
- **Set "Nam Thiên Long" as parent company** (is_parent_company = true)
- **Created index** `idx_companies_is_parent` for performance

### 2. Updated Interfaces (lib/schema.ts)
```typescript
export interface Company {
  // ... existing fields
  is_parent_company: boolean; // ✅ Added
  // ...
}

export interface Department {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  // company_id: number; // ✅ Removed
  description: string;
  manager_name: string;
  employee_count: number;
  created_at: Date;
}
```

### 3. Updated API Routes

#### `/api/companies/[id]/departments`
- **GET**: Now returns all departments with employee counts per company
- **POST**: Creates departments without company_id (belongs to parent company)

#### `/api/companies/stats`
- **Updated departments count**: Now counts distinct departments that have employees in specific company

#### New Routes Created:
- `/api/departments` - Get all departments (belong to parent company)
- `/api/companies/parent` - Get/Set parent company
- `/api/companies/subsidiaries` - Get all subsidiary companies

### 4. Updated Database Functions (lib/db.ts)
```typescript
// ✅ Added new functions
export async function getParentCompany()
export async function getSubsidiaryCompanies()  
export async function getAllDepartments()
export async function getDepartmentById()
```

## 🏗️ New Business Logic

### Company Structure:
- **1 Parent Company**: Owns all departments
- **Multiple Subsidiary Companies**: Employees work for subsidiaries but belong to parent company departments

### Employee-Department-Company Relationship:
```
Employee -> Department (parent company) + Company (subsidiary)
```

### Example:
- **Parent Company**: "Nam Thiên Long" (is_parent_company = true)
- **Departments**: "Công Nghệ", "Marketing", "Nhân Sự" (no company_id)
- **Subsidiary**: "ApecTech" (is_parent_company = false)
- **Employee**: John belongs to "Công Nghệ" department and works for "ApecTech" company

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Database Connection & Structure:
```bash
node test-migration.js
```

### Test API Endpoints:
1. **Get Parent Company**: `GET /api/companies/parent`
2. **Get All Departments**: `GET /api/departments`  
3. **Get Subsidiaries**: `GET /api/companies/subsidiaries`
4. **Company Departments**: `GET /api/companies/1/departments`

## 🔧 Migration Files
- `migrations/009_update_company_department_structure.sql` - Main migration
- `test-migration.js` - Test script
- `run-migration.js` - Migration runner

## 📊 Current Database State
- **Parent Company**: Nam Thiên Long (ID: 1)
- **Departments Structure**: No company_id field
- **Employees**: Still have both department_id and company_id
- **All APIs**: Updated to work with new structure

## 🎯 Benefits
1. **Simplified Management**: All departments managed centrally
2. **Flexible Organization**: Employees can work for any subsidiary while belonging to parent company departments  
3. **Consistent Branding**: Parent company logo used as main logo
4. **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new subsidiary companies

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Parent Company Logo**: Frontend should use parent company logo as main logo
- **Employee Management**: Employees still belong to both department and company
- **Department Creation**: New departments belong to parent company only
- **Statistics**: Company stats now count departments by employee association
